= Introduction =

If you need to utilize personal or unimplemented MetaData content it can be easily created by generating a derived class.  This will allow you the freedom to utilize any form of metadata you see fit.

= Instructions = 

  # Download and Configure the Digital Asset Management Client.
  # Create a new class in org.cc.dam.metadata which derives from org.cc.dam.metadata.MetaDataList.
   *(Note: The general Naming Scheme is MetaDataList??? where the question marks are replaced by the name of the metadata.  i.e. MetaDataListDC for dublin core.
  # Your constructor should add all tags to a storage mechanism a vector is provided by the super class.
  # If you are not using the predefined vector for storage you must implement the methods 'String[] getTags()' and 'int numTags()'.
  # Regardless you must implement 'boolean isValid(String tag, String value)' and 'boolean containsTag(String tag)', which determine if a tag has valid data and if the tag is in the metadata list respectively.
  # Once you have finished with the tag you currently need to update org.cc.dam.MetaDataLoader to add an instance of the MetaDataClass in the constructor.
