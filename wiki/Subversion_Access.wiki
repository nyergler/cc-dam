To checkout and run code from our Subversion repository, it is most convenient if you have [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] configured with the [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Tigris Subclipse] plugin.  Please follow the instructions on the Subclipse page to install the plugin and then add a repository for [http://code.google.com/p/cc-dam/svn].

This project is composed of several sub-projects.  These are found in the [http://cc-dam.googlecode.com/svn/projects/ projects/] directory at the root of the Subversion repository.  In order to utilize these sub-projects in combination within Eclipse, you need to check them out individually into separate directories in your workspace.  To have a fully-functional system, you need to check out the "trunk" directory for each sub-project; Eclipse should automatically name the checked-out directories according to the sub-project name (e.g. org.cc.xmp).
