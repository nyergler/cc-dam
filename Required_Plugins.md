# Apache Derby Plugin #

Currently, the Digial Asset Management system relies on [Derby](http://db.apache.org/derby/), an all-Java database from the [Apache Foundation](http://www.apache.org/).  This functionality is available directly as a plugin for Eclipse.

The recommended way for installing the Eclipse Derby plugin is through the Eclipse Software Updates mechanism.  Select to install new features, and use the Callisto Discovery Site as a source.  After the available features are collected, select "Apache Derby Core" from the "Enabling Features" sublist.

You can find more information about the Apache Derby plugin [on the official page](http://db.apache.org/derby/integrate/derby_plugin.html).
